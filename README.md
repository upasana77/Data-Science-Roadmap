# Data-Science-Roadmap for 6 month.
Month 1:

Introduction to data science, its applications, and importance.
Introduction to Python programming language and data science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
Introduction to data analysis and manipulation with Pandas.
Basics of statistical inference, including hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.
Month 2:

Introduction to data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Introduction to machine learning and its applications.
Supervised learning algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, and decision trees.
Unsupervised learning algorithms such as k-means clustering and principal component analysis (PCA).
Month 3:

Deep dive into linear regression and logistic regression.
Model selection techniques, such as cross-validation and regularization.
Introduction to natural language processing (NLP) and text mining.
Month 4:

Advanced machine learning techniques, including ensemble methods (e.g., random forests, gradient boosting) and neural networks (e.g., feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks).
Introduction to time-series analysis and forecasting.
Month 5:

Advanced data visualization techniques, including interactive visualizations with Plotly and Bokeh.
Introduction to big data technologies such as Apache Spark and Hadoop.
Introduction to data engineering, including data pipelines and ETL (extract, transform, load) processes.
Month 6:

Advanced topics such as reinforcement learning, generative models (e.g., GANs), and deep reinforcement learning.
Final project, where you apply the skills learned throughout the course to solve a real-world problem.
